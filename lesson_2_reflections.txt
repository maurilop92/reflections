What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created in the root folder so Git can track all your commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a temporal folder where you put all the files you
intend to commit together so you can group logical changes.
