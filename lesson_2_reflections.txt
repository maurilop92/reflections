What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created in the root folder so Git can track all your commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a temporal folder where you put all the files you
intend to commit together so you can group logical changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can group files that you want to commit together, and you can also check
the difference between the files in the staging area against those previously
commited to be sure that what you want to commit is there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Mostly when you want to experiment or add something to the program that you
don't know if it's going to work as intended. If it does, you can later merge
branches together so all your program becomes one, but if doesn't, you just can
delete the branch and keep working on the previous code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show a parent-child relationship between commits, and also explain the
concept of detached HEAD state (a commit that currently doesn't belong to a
branch).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The code in both branches gets joined and the commits from the merged branch are
added to the master, so the merged branch can be deleted, that's why in the
diagram is represented as a convergence of paths.
